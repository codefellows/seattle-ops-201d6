# Ops 201: Foundations of Computer Operations

## Course Information

- Course Level: Ops 201

## Course Prerequisites

- Ops 101
- Ops 102

> Students with previous relevant or equivalent experience can test out of this requirement in their application.

## Course Description

In this hands-on course, you will build up foundational Windows troubleshooting skills by exploring and overcoming challenging scenario-based labs. Key skills such as communication, knowledge and process documentation, fundamental terminal operations, performance monitoring, system process management, issue handling, backup/imaging/recovery tools, and software application operations are developed.

The course focuses on practical systems support and troubleshooting. Students will utilize the CompTIA troubleshooting methodology as well as the ITIL service management framework to communicate, resolve, and document issues and incidents. Students will also study how endpoints interact with the greater IT infrastructure, exploring concepts such as network ports and protocols, Wi-Fi, and server-based user identity support.

## Certification

This course will substantially prepare you for achieving the learning objectives of CompTIA ITF+ certification, and beyond. This course covers significant aspects of five of the six domains required for ITF+.

- CompTIA ITF+ FC0-U61
  - 1.0 IT Concepts and Terminology
  - 2.0 Infrastructure
  - 3.0 Applications and Software
  - 4.0 Software Development Concepts
  - 6.0 Security

> Students register for the CompTIA ITF+ exam during course prework, and take the exam during the final module. The studentâ€™s resulting score from taking CompTIA ITF+ is then factored into the final grade for this course. Passing this course is largely contingent upon passing CompTIA ITF+.

## Required Materials

### Personal Computer/Laptop

By the start of the first class, you need a working computer meeting the school-specified requirements.

### Ops Lab Kit

Ops courses require a second computer for lab. By the start of the first class, you will need to have obtained an Ops Lab Kit as directed by your school.

### Internet Connection

Each student is responsible for their access to the internet for purposes of this course and for research. Internet access is a required component of this course and will not be accepted as an excuse for missed work. If you know that you will be traveling, then make sure you plan accordingly.
