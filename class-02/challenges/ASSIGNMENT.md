# Ops Challenge - My First Bash Script

Welcome to your first Ops Challenge assignment! Ops Challenges are designed to build your scripting and automation skills in the most industry relevant languages.

Scripting is useful for automating tasks on systems. By executing a script, we can automate the tedium of a human being present at the terminal typing each command. To do this, we'll need to know basic software development concepts. In the first week of this class, we'll study the absolute fundamentals.

The objective of the Ops Challenge series in Ops 201 is to create a useful systems administration and troubleshooting script in either Bash, PowerShell or Z shell. You'll start from scratch and build in new features to your tool every day. Our first stop will be using variables.

## Objectives

- Create a script that prints a string to the console.

First, if you haven't already, setup VS Code as per today's lab assignment to shell into your dedicated scripting VM. See lab assignment for details.

### Part 2: Creating and Running the Script

1. In your SSH session, use the `touch` command to create `helloworld.sh` in your git-initialized directory.
1. Open `helloworld.sh` with VS Code
1. Using the template below as your guide, create the script that will print "I am working perfectly" to the screen.
1. Test your script by running it from the command line in SSH, like this:
   `bash helloworld.sh`

## Execution Instructions
