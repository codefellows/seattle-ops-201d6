# Ops Challenge - My First Bash Script

Welcome to your first Ops Challenge assignment! Ops Challenges are designed to build your scripting and automation skills in the most industry relevant languages. In Ops 201 we'll kick things off with Bash.

Scripting is useful for automating tasks on Linux systems. By executing a script, we can automate the tedium of a human being present at the terminal typing each command. To do this, we'll need to know basic software development concepts. In the first week of this class, we'll study the absolute fundamentals.

The objective of the Ops Challenge series in Ops 201 is to create a set of useful systems administration and troubleshooting scripts. Our first stop will be using variables.
