# Shell Functions

Like other programming languages, the shell may have functions. A function is a subroutine that implements a set of commands and operations. It is useful for repeated tasks.

    # basic construct
    function function_name {
      command...
    }

Functions are called simply by writing their names. A function call is equivalent to a command. Parameters may be passed to a function, by specifying them after the function name. The first parameter is referred to in the function as `$1`, the second as `$2` etc.

    function function_B {
      echo "Function B."
    }
    function function_A {
      echo "$1"
    }
    function adder {
      echo "$(($1 + $2))"
    }

    # FUNCTION CALLS
    # Pass parameter to function A
    function_A "Function A."     # Function A.
    function_B                   # Function B.
    # Pass two parameters to function adder
    adder 12 56                  # 68

## Exercise

In this exercise, you will need to write a function called ENGLISH_CALC which can process sentences such as:

'3 plus 5', '5 minus 1' or '4 times 6' and print the results as: '3 + 5 = 8', '5 - 1 = 4' or '4 * 6 = 24' respectively.

### Tutorial Code

    #!/bin/zsh
    # enter your function code here

    # testing code
    ENGLISH_CALC 3 plus 5
    ENGLISH_CALC 5 minus 1
    ENGLISH_CALC 4 times 6

### Expected Output

    3 + 5 = 8
    5 - 1 = 4
    4 * 6 = 24

### Solution

```zsh
#!/bin/zsh
# enter your function code here

function ENGLISH_CALC {
  a=$1
  b=$3
  signn=$2
  if [ $signn = "plus" ]; then
    echo "$a + $b = $(($a+$b))"
  elif [ $signn = "minus" ]; then
    echo "$a - $b = $(($a-$b))"
  elif [ $signn = "times" ]; then
    echo "$a * $b = $(($a*$b))"
  fi
}

# testing code
ENGLISH_CALC 3 plus 5
ENGLISH_CALC 5 minus 1
ENGLISH_CALC 4 times 6
```
