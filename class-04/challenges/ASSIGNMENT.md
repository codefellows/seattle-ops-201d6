# Ops Challenge - Arrays

## Overview

Arrays let us maintain sets of data in memory. This is another core programming concept you'll need moving forward. Knowing these core concepts will help you automate repetitive tasks like directory creation.

## Objectives

- Write a script that:
  - Creates four directories: dir1, dir2, dir3, dir4
  - Put the names of the four directories in an array
  - References the array variable to create a new .txt file in each directory

## Resources

- [Bash arrays](https://linuxhandbook.com/bash-arrays/){:target="_blank"}
- [Bash concatenate strings](https://linuxize.com/post/bash-concatenate-strings/){:target="_blank"}
- Tutorials
  - [Bash](demo/bash.md)
  - [PowerShell](demo/powershell.md)
  - [Z shell](demo/zsh.md)

## Tasks

Today's script is a form of automation.
- Review the process for creating a new directory.
- Create four directories using the script.
- Load each directory path into an array.
- create a new .txt file within each directory by referencing the directory with array indices, not the literal directory path.
- Test & validate.
