# Arrays

An array can hold several values under one name. Array naming is the same as variables naming.
An array is initialized by assign space-delimited values enclosed in ()

    my_array=(apple banana "Fruit Basket" orange)
    new_array[2]=apricot

Array members need not be consecutive or contiguous. Some members of the array can be left uninitialized.

The total number of elements in the array is referenced by `${#arrayname[@]}`

    my_array=(apple banana "Fruit Basket" orange)
    echo  ${#my_array[@]}                   # 4

The array elements can be accessed with their numeric index. The index of the first element is 0.

    my_array=(apple banana "Fruit Basket" orange)
    echo ${my_array[3]}                     # orange - note that curly brackets are needed
    # adding another array element
    my_array[4]="carrot"                    # value assignment without a $ and curly brackets
    echo ${#my_array[@]}                    # 5
    echo ${my_array[${#my_array[@]}-1]}     # carrot

## Exercise

In this exercise, you will need to add numbers and strings to the correct arrays. You must add the numbers 1,2, and 3 to the "numbers" array, and the words 'hello' and 'world' to the strings array.

You will also have to correct the values of the variable `NumberOfNames` and the variable `second_name`. `NumberOfNames` should hold the total number of names in the NAMES array, using the `$#` special variable. Variable `second_name` should hold the second name in the `NAMES` array, using the brackets operator [ ]. Note that the index is zero-based, so if you want to access the second item in the list, its index will be 1.

### Tutorial Code

    #!/bin/bash
    NAMES=( John Eric Jessica )
    # write your code here
    NUMBERS=()
    STRINGS=()
    NumberOfNames=0
    second_name='Vladimir'

### Expected Output

    1 2 3
    hello world
    The number of names listed in the NAMES array: 3
    The second name on the NAMES list is: Eric

### Solution

```bash
#!/bin/bash
NAMES=( John Eric Jessica )
# write your code here
NUMBERS=( 1 2 3 )
STRINGS=( "hello" "world" )
NumberOfNames=${#NAMES[@]}
second_name=${NAMES[1]}
echo ${NUMBERS[@]}
echo ${STRINGS[@]}
echo "The number of names listed in the NAMES array: $NumberOfNames"
echo "The second name on the NAMES list is:" ${second_name}
```
