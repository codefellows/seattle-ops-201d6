# Ops Challenge - Loops

## Overview

Loops let us repeat an operation either indefinitely or for a fixed number of repetitions in a program. There are two types of loops to be aware of: "while" loops and "for" loops.

## Objectives

- Write a script that displays running processes, asks the user for a PID, then kills the process with that PID.
- Use a loop in your script.

  - [Bash](demo/bash.md)
  - [PowerShell](demo/powershell.md)
  - [Z shell](demo/zsh.md)

## Tasks

- Write a script that displays running processes, asks the user for a PID, then kills the process with that PID.
  - For this part of the lab, initialize a process that won't harm the OS's functionality upon termination. Don't kill essential processes required for the OS to work, such as kernel drivers.
- Use a loop in your script.
  - This loop will facilitate the menu system of your script, so that it can prompt the user to choose an option.
