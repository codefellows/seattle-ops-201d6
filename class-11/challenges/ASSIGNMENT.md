# Ops Challenge - Automated Endpoint Configuration

## Overview

Standing up Windows 10 endpoints from scratch can be extremely time-consuming. You'll want to automate Windows system configurations as much as possible, to save yourself precious time. In class, we can simply export an OVA of a Windows 10 VM; however, in a production operations environment, you may not have such luxuries. It's good to get a sense of how Powershell can contribute to this effort.

## Scenario

Your team wants to automate the systems configuration of new Windows 10 deployments.

## Objectives

Write a Powershell script that automates the configuration of a new Windows 10 endpoint. Your script should perform the following:
- Enable File and Printer Sharing
- Allow ICMP traffic
- Enable Remote management
- Remove bloatware
- Enable Hyper-V
- Disable SMBv1, an insecure protocol

Test and validate that your script achieves the desired outcome for each listed objective. Put screenshots and discussion of your testing into a Google Doc.

## Tasks

Your script should perform the following:
- Enable File and Printer Sharing
- Allow ICMP traffic
- Enable Remote management
- Remove bloatware
- Enable Hyper-V
- Disable SMBv1, an insecure protocol

Test and validate that your script achieves the desired outcome for each listed objective. Put screenshots and discussion of your testing into a Google Doc.
- Did your script enable File and Printer Sharing?
  - What did you do to test before/after?
- Did your script allow ICMP traffic?
  - What did you do to test before/after?
- Did your script enable Remote management?
  - What did you do to test before/after?
- Did your script remove bloatware?
  - What did you do to test before/after?
- Did your script enable Hyper-V?
  - What did you do to test before/after?
- Did your script disable SMBv1?
  - What did you do to test before/after?
