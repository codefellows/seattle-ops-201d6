# Virtualizing a Router with pfSense

## Overview

Many computing devices that were traditionally physical hardware appliances have since been virtualized into portable files, much like those you've worked with such as .iso and .ova files. Additionally, open source software solutions have gained tremendous popularity due to their versatility, transparency, and accessibility. Thus far, you've used Ubuntu Linux, an open source OS. Our next open source software we'll use is pfSense, a router/firewall that we can deploy to the lab computer to learn about networking.
