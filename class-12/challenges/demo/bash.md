# Basic String Operations

The shell allows some common string operations which can be very useful for script writing.

## String Length

    #     1234567890123456
    STRING="this is a string"
    echo ${#STRING}            # 16

## Index

Find the numerical position in `$STRING` of any single character in `$SUBSTRING` that matches. Note that the 'expr' command is used in this case.

    STRING="this is a string"
    SUBSTRING="hat"
    expr index "$STRING" "$SUBSTRING"     # 1 is the position of the first 't' in $STRING

## Substring Extraction

Extract substring of length `$LEN` from `$STRING` starting after position `$POS`. Note that first position is 0.

    STRING="this is a string"
    POS=1
    LEN=3
    echo ${STRING:$POS:$LEN}   # his

If: `$LEN` is omitted, extract substring from `$POS` to end of line

    STRING="this is a string"
    echo ${STRING:1}           # $STRING contents without leading character
    echo ${STRING:12}          # ring

## Simple data extraction example

    # Code to extract the First name from the data record
    DATARECORD="last=Clifford,first=Johnny Boy,state=CA"
    COMMA1=`expr index "$DATARECORD" ','`  # 14 position of first comma
    CHOP1FIELD=${DATARECORD:$COMMA1}       #
    COMMA2=`expr index "$CHOP1FIELD" ','`
    LENGTH=`expr $COMMA2 - 6 - 1`
    FIRSTNAME=${CHOP1FIELD:6:$LENGTH}      # Johnny Boy
    echo $FIRSTNAME

## Substring Replacement

    STRING="to be or not to be"

### Replace first occurrence of substring with replacement

    STRING="to be or not to be"
    echo ${STRING[@]/be/eat}        # to eat or not to be

### Replace all occurrences of substring

    STRING="to be or not to be"
    echo ${STRING[@]//be/eat}        # to eat or not to eat

### Delete all occurrences of substring (replace with empty string)

    STRING="to be or not to be"
    echo ${STRING[@]// not/}        # to be or to be

### Replace occurrence of substring if at the beginning of $STRING

    STRING="to be or not to be"
    echo ${STRING[@]/#to be/eat now}    # eat now or not to be

### Replace occurrence of substring if at the end of $STRING

    STRING="to be or not to be"
    echo ${STRING[@]/%be/eat}        # to be or not to eat

### replace occurrence of substring with shell command output

    STRING="to be or not to be"
    echo ${STRING[@]/%be/be on $(date +%Y-%m-%d)}    # to be or not to be on 2012-06-14

## Exercise

In this exercise, you will need to change Warren Buffett's known saying. First create a variable ISAY and assign it the original saying value. Then re-assign it with a new changed value using the string operations and following the 4 defined changes:

Change1: replace the first occurrence of 'snow' with 'foot'.

Change2: delete the second occurrence of 'snow'.

Change3: replace 'finding' with 'getting'.

Change4: delete all characters following 'wet'. Tip: One way to implement Change4, if to find the index of 'w' in the word 'wet' and then use substring extraction.

### Tutorial Code

    # !/bin/bash

    BUFFETT="Life is like a snowball. The important thing is finding wet snow and a really long hill."

    # write your code here

    ISAY=
    ISAY=

    # Test code - do not modify

    echo "Warren Buffett said:"
    echo $BUFFETT
    echo "and I say:"
    echo $ISAY

### Expected Output

    Warren Buffett said:
    Life is like a snowball. The important thing is finding wet snow and a really long hill.
    and I say:
    Life is like a football. The important thing is getting wet

### Solution

```bash
# !/bin/bash

BUFFETT="Life is like a snowball. The important thing is finding wet snow and a really long hill."

    # write your code here
    ISAY=$BUFFETT
    change1=${ISAY[@]/snow/foot}
    change2=${change1[@]//snow/}
    change3=${change2[@]/finding/getting}
    loc=`expr index "$change3" 'w'`
    ISAY=${change3::$loc+2}

# Test code - do not modify

echo "Warren Buffett said:"
echo $BUFFETT
echo "and I say:"
echo "$ISAY"
```
