# Repo and Tooling

Today we will create your GitHub org, project repo(s) and setup your tooling for project management.

## Build your Repo

It is now time to begin preparations for your Group Project. The next step for group projects is to create a repository where you will do your work.

### Tasks

Each group should create a GitHub “Organization”, add team members as members of the organization, and create the repositories there. Don't forget to customize everyone's permissions so that all team members are an "Admin".

The name of the org and the repo should **resume-ready**. Use the app name, the problem domain, or another professional-sounding team name. Don't call it `201Final` or `project-week-app` or `reeses-puffs` or similar.

> This project may well be a key piece of your portfolio. Potential employers will be looking at this project. Name it accordingly.

Then, complete the following:

1. Create a repo to hold all project prep documentation.
  - Create a basic `README.md` file within this repo that contains the names of all the members as well as a short description of the project.
1. Create a second repo to hold any scripts.
  - Create a basic `README.md` file within this repo that contains the names of all the members and a short description of the scripts, what they do and what they are used for.
1. Create a third repo that will link all SOPs.
  - Create a basic `README.md` file within this repo that contains the names of all the members and a short description of SOPs.

## PM Tools

Make sure everyone has access and permissions to the PM tooling you are using. Make any appropriate or required associations or connections between Github and your tool.

If you are unfamiliar with any PM tools, here are a few suggestions:

1. [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira){:target="_blank"}
1. [Trello](https://trello.com/){:target="_blank"}
1. [GitHub Projects](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-project-boards){:target="_blank"}
1. [SpiceWorks](https://www.spiceworks.com/free-help-desk-software){:target="_blank"}
1. [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/?nav=min){:target="_blank"}

## Submitting Your Work

**Only one person needs to submit this assignment for the group to receive credit**
In the text area, write the name of your client company, the names of all the members and provide a link to the organization you have created.

_This assignment will be graded based on your naming of your repos (and org) as described, how it's configured, and your completeness in following all instructions._
